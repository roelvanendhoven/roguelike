As the dark night sun consumes the ruins of Gronn, mists shroud the twisted nether, deep below the empire's lands...

A haven for the foul beings that were cast upon the miserable plains of Saggranath by Doom Gaoler Phi'll.

For thousands of aeons, peace was kept by the Golden Army of the Lord's Seven Divine Swords.

Until that faithful yet unholy night, when blood gurgled screams filled the foul, rotten, air.

It was then, that all hope vanished. Children fled to their beds, hoping their sheets would provide shelter from that which was to come...


As the ground ruptured with a deafening cry, evil spewed from the cracks like sparks cast from the blacksmith's forge.


Bewildered, you find yourself...
What does this all mean?
